Smart contracts implemented in Solidity for Diversify.

## Introduction

The Diversify Token (DIV) is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum Blockchain. It has a deflationary, democratic and diversified character.

The total issuance of the token is 1,000,000,000 DIV. With its diversified underlying asset, the token price is backed and a deflationary structure is implemented by an 1% burning rate with every transaction. The burning stops as soon as a total of 100 000 000 DIV tokens is reached.
Additionally, 0.25% of every transaction are sent to the Diversify Foundation Wallet. These funds will be used to invest in shares of renewable energy companies and charity. The foundation rate of 0.25% is part of the upgradable contract, which stands for the convertibility of the contract after the initial deployment. A minimum and maximum for this rate is irreversibly defined between 0% to 2.5%. This enables the Diversify community to have a vote about how high this rate should be. There are three token offerings â€“ a Seed Sale, a Strategic Sale and a Global Sale.
